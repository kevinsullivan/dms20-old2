# lean-tutorials

The goal of this project is to gather tutorials and demo files for Lean
beginners, allowing to see what it looks like without reading 
much documentation. Currently there is one such tutorial.

Of course you can look at [this file](src/first_proofs.lean) online but
the recommended way it to [install Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/README.md) and [get this project](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md) for local use.

If you have already installed Lean and mathlib in the recommended manner, and have access to a command line, then installing this project should be as simple as

```
git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/tutorials.git
cd tutorials
leanpkg configure
update-mathlib
```
